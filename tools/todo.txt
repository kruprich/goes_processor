I want the following data per each individual ABI product's output pixel

expected pixels = expected pixels (expected input pixels per bin * corrison factor)

valid pixels = pixels that are present and that do not have a bad DQF

valid pixel fraction = valid pixles / expected input pixels (expected files per bin for ABI * corrison factor)


I want this data for each individual ABI prodcuts bin 

expected files = (expected ABI files per each bin * corrison factor)

actual valid files downloaded = (actual valid files downloaded per bin * corrison factor)

valid file fraction = expected files / actual valid files downloaded


For GLM I want the following for each bin

expected files = (expected glm files per each bin * corrison factor)

actual valid files downloaded = (actual valid files downloaded per bin * corrison factor)

valid file fraction = expected files / actual valid files downloaded
