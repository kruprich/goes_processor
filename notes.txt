longitude_of_projection_origin is taken once a day from the ABI L2 data. If it changes intra day this is not recognized until the next day. Ideally it would be picked up every minimum time frame. I believe this poses a very minor issue



TODO: Grab all ABI L2 CONUS standard grid size meta data for GLM to standard grid conversion

TODO: ADD filed for Satellite source 

TODO: Enforce 5 min windows throughout the day for L2 GLM files. Add each file to the bucket if start time >= bucket start and end time < bucket end

TODO: Validate number of GLM files per 5 min bucket. If != 15 then add a GLM file missing file indicator 

TODO: Enforce 5 min windows throughout the day for ABI files. Map ABI to each 5 min window. Add each file to the bucket if start time >= bucket start and end time < bucket end

TODO: If != 1 ABI file per 5 min window add the respective ABI product bad file indicator and a bad file reason indicator detailing over the expected files per window, below the expected amount of files per window, no files for window.

TODO: Add ABI L2 CONUS standard grid size constraint. This is so I can trim the standard grid to a smaller subset of the grid size based on the overlap between GOES-16 and GOES-19. Or just make predictions for a smaller region

TODO: Parameterize everything including window size and aggregated pixel size

Grab ABI projection data once per 5 min window
